<a href="http://www.mapitsoftware.com/english/mapit/history.htm">Since human beings first walked planet Earth, memory has been one of the main concerns and interests. If early homo sapiens forgot, it was not only a matter of not remembering, it was often a matter of no longer living: if you could not remember which snakes were poisonous; which fruit was nutritious; where you had hidden your implements and weapons; where swamps, quick-sands and chasms were located; and where your secret supplies of food were, you did not get many more opportunities to try to remember anything!
<br />
<br />Looking at memory from this basic and survival point of view, we quickly realise that memory is not just a matter of recalling shopping lists and information for exams - it is literally a matter of life and death. It is for this reason that all cultures throughout history have devoted large amounts of their time and energy to making sure that there â€˜memory systemsâ€™ were both excellent and improving.</a>

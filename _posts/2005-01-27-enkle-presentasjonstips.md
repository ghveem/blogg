<blockquote>Doing Things in 3s
<br />I've been re-doing some very big MindMaps I've created in MindManager, and it's doing my head in.
<br />I just can't seem to look at the MindMap and take in all the information, even though it's my own map.
<br />
<br />So here's an idea I've had.  Re-arrange the whole map so there are never more than 3 sub-topics, and then split them into no more than 3 sub-topics and keep drilling down in 3s.  It seems to be working well so far.  I've started with more than 3 Main Topics at the start, but I've kept the 3s after that.
<br />
<br />It's something I picked up from a Presentation Skills workshop years ago.
<br />Work in 3s.
<br />Beginning Middle End
<br />Aim to tell the audience 3 things, and have them go away remembering 3 things, and break down the 3 things each into 3 things when you're explaining the 3 things!"

<a href="http://glef.org/magazine/ed1article.php?id=art_1160&amp;issue=sept_04">Life on the Screen</a>: "When people talk to me about the digital divide, I think of it not being so much about who has access to what technology as who knows how to create and express themselves in this new language of the screen. If students aren't taught the language of sound and images, shouldn't they be considered as illiterate as if they left college without being able to read or write?"

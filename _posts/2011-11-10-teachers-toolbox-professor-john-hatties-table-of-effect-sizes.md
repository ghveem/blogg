An effect-size of 1.0 is typically associated with: </p>  		  <p class="content">•&nbsp; advancing learners' achievement by one year, or improving the rate of learning by 50% </p>  		  <p class="content">•&nbsp; a correlation between some variable (e.g., amount of homework) and achievement of approximately .50 </p>  		  <p class="content">•&nbsp; A two grade leap in GCSE, e.g. from a C to an A grade</p>  		  <p class="content">An effect size of 1.0 is clearly enormous! (It is defined as an increase of one standard deviation)</p>  		  <p class="content"><strong>Below is Hattie's table of effect sizes.</strong></p></blockquote>    <div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.teacherstoolbox.co.uk/T_effect_sizes.html#feedback">teacherstoolbox.co.uk</a></div> <p></p></div>      <p style="font-size: 10px;">  <a href="http://posterous.com">Posted via email</a>   from <a href="http://ghveem.posterous.com/teachers-toolbox-professor-john-hatties-table">ghveem</a>  </p>  </div>

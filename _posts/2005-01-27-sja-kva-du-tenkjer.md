<blockquote>What intrigues me about this list of applications is that some of them are left-brain, deductive processes while others are right-brain, inductive, creative processes. I've often used pencil and paper to sketch out cause-and-effect (systems thinking) and process diagrams (which are more linear), but recently I've started playing with mind maps as a personal 'thinking out loud' tool, to organize my thoughts and think creatively all by myself. I've always learned best by writing, synthesizing and distilling books and other voluminous materials down to their essence: the message, the meaning, and the necessary actions. So perhaps this 'learning by writing down' style is the reason I find mind maps useful. </blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.salon.com/0002007/categories/businessInnovation/2005/01/05.html">Les meir</a>
